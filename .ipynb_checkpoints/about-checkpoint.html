    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a Data Scientist and a Physicist. I am a Theoretical High-Energy Physicist by training with more tha ten years of experience in active research. I have verified and improved upon important conjectures related to Black Hole dynamics using advanced mathematical and Quantum Field Theoretic and Quantum Information methods used in the area of Quantum Gravity and particularly String Theory. I am also active as an ML Physicist in the Astrophysics group of Prof. Shravan Hanasoge trying to explore the effectiveness of Deep Neural Networks in trying to predict Solar wind speeds. I have also been part of numerous international scientific collaborations -having lead some of them myself. I breifly decribe my skills below:</p>
      <p>I also have recently finished Le Wagon's intensive 9-week Data Science and AI Bootcamp aimed at industry specfic skills maintinaing a perfect 100% score throughout.</p>

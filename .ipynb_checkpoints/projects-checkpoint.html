      <h3>Solar Weather Prediction using ML (Ongoing)</h3>
      <p>Ongoing project with the astrophysics group led by Prof. Shravan Hanasoge (DAA, TIFR-Mumbai, India and NYU, Abhu Dhabi), invovles predicticng solar wind speed using data from different sources. Chiefly using the Interplanetary Scintillation (IPS) data produced from radio telescope observations at Nagoya University and OMNI data produced by NASA's OMNI stellite at the L1 stationary point between Earth and the Sun. Here the radio telescopes observations record disturbance to the radio signal from distant sources in the sky due to solar winds in transit from the Sun to Earth. These wind speeds ranging 200 - 800 km/s take 2-4 days to reach earth. It consists of highly interacting charged plasma complex enough to resist any current methods of Magnetohydrodynamics at studying them.

      <h3>Bumblebee Classification using Inception and YOLOv5</h3>
      <p>Final project as a part of Le Wangon's Data Science and AI Bootcamp where me and my team developed a Bumblebee subspecies detection app full with Docker containerization, FastAPI, Streamlit, and the app being deployed on GCP. Me and my teammates used the work published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87210-1" target="_blank">Nature</a> to develop this app. This was achieved within a timeline of 10 days. As the base model was the same as that was used in the above paper, I further imporved the accuracy by training a YOLOv5 model to detect a possible Bumblebee in the image thus increasing the accuracy from 81% to 86%.

      <h3>Asynchronous gRPC + RAGFlow API integration</h3>
      <p>RAGFlow is an open-source engine designed for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows where choosen large language model (LLM) is given retrieved relevant context from external data before generating a response. On the other hand  gRPC (short for gRPC Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance, open-source framework developed by Google for enabling efficient communication between distributed systems and microservices. I have developed an very simple asynchronous implementation of gRPC Server serving some of the RAGFlow's REST API endpoints. I have also implemented a corresponding gRPC client which can access these endpoints via the server. This was done via a docker compose yaml implementation of containerization where both the RAGFlow service and the gRPC server are containerized. One can further use this implementaion as a base to expand the RAGFlow HTTP endpoints to be served by the gRPC server. Note: Not all of RAGFlow's HTTP endpoints have been documented, especially the ones I have implemented in this project.

      <h3>German text querying app (ongoing)</h3>
      <p>This project implements a chatbot to query a German text in English and recive answers about the text in English. This would use The open-source Ollama server to both translate the German document to English, chunking the texts, create and store embeddings, implement RAG for English queries. The whole model is deployed via containerized image and has a streamlit app interface utilising FAST API. </p>

      <h3>Black Hole Dynamics</h3>
      <p>Sytematically analyzed and studied various correlators associated with the boundary data of a variety of black holes using techniques of holography developed in string theoretic frame work of Quantum Gravity. Corrected the famous 'Chaos Bound' associated with black hole dynamics. This 'Chaos bound' bounds the (exponential) rate at which infalling data is scrambeled within the black hole, my analysis was the first one to show that this 'Chaos Bound' is higher for rotating black holes. I used various techniques in General Relativity and Information Theory to ascertain my analyses for generic black holes- especially by analysing the change associated with 'Mutual Information' in the  boundary data of the black holes due to infalling perturbative data at very late times. I further systematically developed the Near Horizon 2-dimensional analysis fleshing out these dynamics in terms of an 'Effective Theory' explaining this enhanced behaviour.   </p>

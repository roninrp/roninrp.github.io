      <h3>Solar Weather Prediction using ML</h3>
      <p>Ongoing project with the astrophysics group led by Prof. Shravan Hanasoge (DAA, TIFR-Mumbai, India and NYU, Abhu Dhabi), invovles predicticng solar wind speed using data from different sources. Chiefly using the Interplanetary Scintillation (IPS) data produced from radio telescope observations at Nagoya University and OMNI data produced by NASA's OMNI stellite at the L1 stationary point between Earth and the Sun. Here the radio telescopes observations record disturbance to the radio signal from distant sources in the sky due to solar winds in transit from the Sun to Earth. These wind speeds ranging 200 - 800 km/s take 2-4 days to reach earth. It consists of highly interacting charged plasma complex enough to resist any current methods of Magnetohydrodynamics at studying them. </p>

      <h3>Black Hole Dynamics</h3>
      <p>Sytematically analyzed and studied various correlators associated with the boundary data of a variety of black holes using techniques of holography developed in string theoretic frame work of Quantum Gravity. Corrected the famous 'Chaos Bound' associated with black hole dynamics. This 'Chaos bound' bounds the (exponential) rate at which infalling data is scrambeled within the black hole, my analysis was the first one to show that this 'Chaos Bound' is higher for rotating black holes. I used various techniques in General Relativity and Information Theory to ascertain my analyses for generic black holes- especially by analysing the change associated with 'Mutual Information' in the  boundary data of the black holes due to infalling perturbative data at very late times. I further systematically developed the Near Horizon 2-dimensional analysis fleshing out these dynamics in terms of an 'Effective Theory' explaining this enhanced behaviour.   </p>

      <h3>Solar Weather Prediction using ML</h3>
      <p>Ongoing project with the astrophysics group led by Prof. Shravan Hanasoge (DAA, TIFR-Mumbai, Inida and NYU, Abhu Dabhi), invovles predicticng solar wind speed using data from different sources. Chiefly using the Interplanetary Scintillation (IPS) data produced from radio telescope observations at Nagoya University and OMNI data produced by NASA's OMNI stellite at the L1 stationary point between Earth and the Sun. Here the radio telescopes observations record disturbance to the radio signal from distant sources in the sky due to solar winds in transit from the Sun to Earth. These wind speeds ranging 200 - 800 km/s take 2-4 days to reach earth. It consists of highly interacting charged plasma complex enough to resist any current methods of Magnetohydrodynamics at studying them. </p>
